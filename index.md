## PROJECT 7

```markdown
Learning Objectives:

1. Gain more experience working with GitHub repos
2. Gain experience working with GitHub Pages
3. Create an CIT Minor portfolio for labs/projects

Overview: 

Rather than a final coding project, this project 
consists of creating an initial version of your 
CIT Minor portfolio using GitHub Pages. 
This project includes:

1. Creating either an organization-level or user-level 
   GitHub Page, and adding content to this Page. This 
   Page will be the entry web page for your portfolio.
2. Creating repos for each of the labs and projects 
   for the CIT 281 class
3. Creating a GitHub Page for each of the labs and 
   projects that provides a brief description of the 
   lab or project, and a screen capture
4. Adding links to the organization or user Page to 
   each of the labs and projects

```

### Technologies Used:
- Terminal
- GitHub
- Chrome


### What I Learned:
In this project, I was able to make a few different GitHub repositories and experiment with GitHub pages. I created a main GitHub Page for my CIT Minor and a total of 16 other repositories for my 9 labs and 7 projects. I also added each project and lab code to its respective page.
